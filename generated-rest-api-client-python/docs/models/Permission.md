# papermerge_restapi_client.model.permission.Permission

A `ModelSerializer` is just a regular `Serializer`, except that:  * A set of default fields are automatically populated. * A set of default validators are automatically populated. * Default `.create()` and `.update()` implementations are provided.  The process of automatically determining a set of serializer fields based on the model fields is reasonably complex, but you almost certainly don't need to dig into the implementation.  If the `ModelSerializer` class *doesn't* generate the set of fields that you need you should either declare the extra/differing fields explicitly on the serializer class, or simply use a `Serializer` class.   Included Mixins:  * A mixin class to enable sparse fieldsets is included * A mixin class to enable validation of included resources is included
